# pqc-iot-retrofit-scanner
pqc-iot-retrofit-scanner addresses the critical security gap in IoT devices facing quantum threats. Motivated by TechRadar's "smart-meter PQC challenge" and ISACA's call for 2035 compliance, this tool automatically scans embedded firmware, identifies quantum-vulnerable cryptography, and generates drop-in post-quantum replacements.
