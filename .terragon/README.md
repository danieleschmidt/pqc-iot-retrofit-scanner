# Terragon Autonomous SDLC Value Discovery System

This directory contains the implementation of the Terragon Autonomous SDLC system that continuously discovers, prioritizes, and executes the highest-value work items for your repository.

## 🎯 System Overview

The Terragon system transforms your repository into a self-improving entity that:
- **Continuously discovers** work items from multiple sources
- **Intelligently prioritizes** using WSJF + ICE + Technical Debt scoring
- **Autonomously executes** highest-value items with full validation
- **Learns and adapts** based on execution outcomes

## 📁 Components

### Core Files

- **`value-config.yaml`** - Central configuration for discovery, scoring, and execution
- **`value-discovery.py`** - Core value discovery engine with multi-source analysis
- **`autonomous-executor.py`** - Autonomous execution engine with validation and rollback
- **`scheduler.py`** - Continuous execution scheduler with multiple triggers

### Generated Files

- **`value-metrics.json`** - Execution metrics and learning data
- **`execution-history.json`** - Complete history of autonomous executions
- **`../BACKLOG.md`** - Live backlog with prioritized work items

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Manual Discovery and Execution

```bash
# Run value discovery
python3 .terragon/value-discovery.py

# View discovered items
cat BACKLOG.md

# Execute highest-value item
python3 .terragon/autonomous-executor.py
```

### 2. Scheduled Autonomous Mode

```bash
# Install required dependency
pip3 install schedule --user

# Run continuous scheduler
python3 .terragon/scheduler.py

# Or run once for testing
python3 .terragon/scheduler.py --once
```

### 3. Claude-Flow Integration (Advanced)

```bash
# Use Claude-Flow for multi-agent execution
npx claude-flow@alpha swarm "AUTONOMOUS SDLC enhancement for repository ${PWD##*/}"
```

## 📊 Repository Assessment

**Current Maturity Level**: MATURING (50-75%)

**Strengths Identified**:
- ✅ Comprehensive structure with proper documentation
- ✅ Security framework (SECURITY.md, threat model)
- ✅ Testing infrastructure (pytest, coverage)
- ✅ CI/CD documentation and workflows
- ✅ Development containers and tooling
- ✅ Monitoring and performance configs

**Enhancement Areas**:
- 🔧 Autonomous value discovery and execution
- 🔧 Continuous technical debt monitoring
- 🔧 Advanced security scanning automation
- 🔧 Performance optimization loops
- 🔧 Compliance tracking and reporting

## 🔍 Discovery Sources

The system discovers work items from:

1. **Git History Analysis** - TODOs, FIXMEs, HACKs, deprecated code
2. **Static Analysis** - Ruff, MyPy, security scanners
3. **Security Scanning** - Safety, vulnerability databases
4. **Dependency Updates** - Outdated packages and libraries
5. **Performance Monitoring** - Bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
6. **Compliance Gaps** - Regulatory and standard requirements

## 🏆 Scoring Model

### WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First)
- **User Business Value** (40%)
- **Time Criticality** (30%)
- **Risk Reduction** (20%)
- **Opportunity Enablement** (10%)

### ICE (Impact, Confidence, Ease)
- **Impact**: Business/technical impact (1-10)
- **Confidence**: Execution confidence (0-1)
- **Ease**: Implementation ease (1-10)

### Technical Debt Scoring
- **Debt Impact**: Maintenance burden
- **Debt Interest**: Future cost growth
- **Hotspot Multiplier**: Code churn analysis

### Composite Scoring
```
Composite = 0.6×WSJF + 0.1×ICE + 0.2×TechDebt + 0.1×Security
```

With category-specific boosts:
- Security vulnerabilities: 2.5x
- Compliance issues: 2.0x
- Performance problems: 1.5x

## ⚙️ Execution Capabilities

The system can autonomously execute:

### ✅ Currently Implemented
- **Dependency Updates** - Documentation and recommendations
- **Technical Debt** - Code annotations and tracking
- **Code Quality** - Auto-formatting and linting fixes
- **Documentation** - Work item tracking and planning

### 🔄 Planned Enhancements
- **Security Patches** - Automated vulnerability fixes
- **Performance Optimizations** - Code improvements
- **Test Coverage** - Automated test generation
- **Infrastructure Updates** - Configuration improvements

## 📈 Continuous Learning

The system learns from each execution:

- **Estimation Accuracy** - Improves effort predictions
- **Value Prediction** - Refines impact assessments
- **Success Patterns** - Identifies execution patterns
- **Risk Assessment** - Adjusts failure probabilities

## 🔒 Safety & Validation

Every execution includes:

1. **Pre-execution Validation** - Dependency and readiness checks
2. **Branch Isolation** - Separate branch for each work item
3. **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit tests, linting, type checking
4. **Automatic Rollback** - On any validation failure
5. **Pull Request Creation** - For human review and approval

## 📅 Execution Schedule

- **Immediate**: On PR merge (webhook integration)
- **Hourly**: Security vulnerability scans
- **Daily 02:00**: Comprehensive value discovery and execution
- **Weekly Mon 03:00**: Deep analysis and batch execution
- **Monthly 1st 04:00**: Strategic review and recalibration

## 🎯 Value Metrics

The system tracks:

- **Cycle Time** - Time from discovery to deployment
- **Value Delivered** - Composite scores of completed items
- **Technical Debt Reduction** - Debt eliminated
- **Security Posture** - Vulnerability reduction
- **Quality Improvements** - Code quality gains
- **Automation ROI** - Time saved vs. effort invested
