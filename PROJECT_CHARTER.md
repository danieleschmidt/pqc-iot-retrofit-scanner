# PQC IoT Retrofit Scanner - Project Charter

## Executive Summary

The PQC IoT Retrofit Scanner addresses the critical security gap facing billions of IoT devices vulnerable to quantum computer attacks. This project delivers an automated solution for identifying quantum-vulnerable cryptography in embedded firmware and generating drop-in post-quantum cryptography replacements.

## Problem Statement

### The Quantum Threat to IoT

By 2035, cryptographically relevant quantum computers may break RSA, ECDSA, and ECDH algorithms currently protecting IoT devices. With average IoT device lifespans of 10-20 years, devices deployed today will remain vulnerable throughout the quantum transition period.

**Current Challenges:**
- Manual cryptographic analysis is time-intensive and error-prone
- Firmware modification requires deep embedded systems expertise  
- No standardized approach for PQC migration in constrained devices
